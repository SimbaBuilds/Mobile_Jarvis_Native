description: Read this rule after modifying native code or dependencies  (Java/Kotlin/Swift/Objective-C) or when attempting a native build
globs: 
alwaysApply: false

Note: This is a react native app in expo with kotlin and java native plugins 

Native Build (Java/Kotlin/Swift/Objective-C):
1. (Default)Run npx expo run:android (for Android) or use 'cd android && ./gradlew :app:compileDebugKotlin' for a surface level (dependecy check) debug 
2. Before release to prod to public or store, run npx expo run:android --variant release  (not doing this any time soon though)

Always ask before running any of the above commands as full rebuilds are time intensive.

If no native (kotlin/java) changes:
1. run npm start 
- human will scan QR code in Expo Go app (Android)
- TS/JS changes appear immediately eith hot reloading
