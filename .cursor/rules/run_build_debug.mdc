description: Read this rule after modifying native code or dependencies  (Java/Kotlin/Swift/Objective-C) or when attempting a native build
globs:

Note: This is a react native app in expo with kotlin and java native plugins 

Native Build (Java/Kotlin/Swift/Objective-C):
1. run cd android && ./gradlew :app:compileDebugKotlin for surface level (dependecy check) debug 
2. run npx expo run:android
2. run npx expo run:android --variant release before release to prod to public or store (not doing this any time soon though)

Always ask before running any of the above commands as full rebuilds are time intensive.

If no native (kotlin/java) changes:
1. run npm start 
- human will scan QR code in Expo Go app (Android)
- TS/JS changes appear immediately eith hot reloading
