Description: Rules for TypeScript (React Native)

# Guidelines
- Use TypeScript with strict mode enabled.
- Prefer functional components over class components.
- Use interfaces for props (e.g., `interface ButtonProps`).
- Avoid `any` typesâ€”always specify explicit types.
- Include error handling for async operations with try/catch.
- Define navigation types using `NativeStackNavigationProp` for type-safe navigation.
- Pass navigation prop to components that need navigation access.
- Use navigation prop from screen options for header actions.
