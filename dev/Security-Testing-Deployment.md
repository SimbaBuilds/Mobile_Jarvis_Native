# React Native Security, Testing, and Deployment Best Practices

> **When to read:** When securing a React Native application, implementing testing strategies, or preparing for app deployment and release to production environments.

## Security

### Implement Secure Storage
- Use secure storage for sensitive data (react-native-keychain or expo-secure-store).
- Don't store sensitive data in AsyncStorage.

```typescript
import * as Keychain from 'react-native-keychain';

// Store credentials
await Keychain.setGenericPassword('username', 'password');

// Retrieve credentials
const credentials = await Keychain.getGenericPassword();
if (credentials) {
  const { username, password } = credentials;
  // Use the credentials
}
```

### Protect Against Common Mobile Vulnerabilities
- Implement certificate pinning for critical API requests.
- Prevent screenshot capture on sensitive screens.
- Implement proper authentication and authorization.

### Secure Environment Variables
- Don't store sensitive information in the JavaScript bundle.
- Use react-native-dotenv with appropriate configuration.

### Code Obfuscation
- Use tools like ProGuard for Android to obfuscate code.
- Consider JavaScript obfuscation for sensitive business logic.

### Network Security
- Always use HTTPS for API requests.
- Implement proper error handling that doesn't expose sensitive information.
- Consider implementing a timeout for API requests.

### App Permissions
- Request only necessary permissions.
- Clearly explain to users why permissions are needed.
- Handle permission denial gracefully.

## Testing and Debugging

### Implement Automated Testing
- Use Jest for unit testing.
- Use React Native Testing Library for component testing.
- Implement E2E testing with Detox or Maestro.

```typescript
// Example component test with React Native Testing Library
import { render, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react-native';
import Button from './Button';

test('calls onPress when pressed', () => {
  const onPressMock = jest.fn();
  const { getByText } = render(<Button title="Press me" onPress={onPressMock} />);
  
  fireEvent.press(getByText('Press me'));
  
  expect(onPressMock).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
});
```

### Use Error Tracking
- Implement crash reporting with Firebase Crashlytics or Sentry.
- Create error boundaries to catch and handle JavaScript errors.

```typescript
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/react-native';

class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  state = { hasError: false };
  
  static getDerivedStateFromError() {
    return { hasError: true };
  }
  
  componentDidCatch(error, errorInfo) {
    Sentry.captureException(error);
  }
  
  render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) {
      return (
        <View style={{ flex: 1, justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}>
          <Text>Something went wrong</Text>
        </View>
      );
    }
    
    return this.props.children;
  }
}

// Usage
const App = () => (
  <ErrorBoundary>
    <MainApp />
  </ErrorBoundary>
);
```

### Debug Tools and Techniques
- Use Flipper or React Native Debugger for debugging.
- Implement feature flags for testing new features in production.
- Use console.warn for development-only warnings.

### Testing Best Practices
- Write tests that verify behavior, not implementation details.
- Use snapshot testing judiciously.
- Set up continuous integration for automated testing.

### Clean Up Console Statements for Production
- Remove console.log statements in production builds.
- Use a babel plugin to automatically remove console statements.

```javascript
// In babel.config.js
module.exports = {
  presets: ['module:metro-react-native-babel-preset'],
  env: {
    production: {
      plugins: ['transform-remove-console'],
    },
  },
};
```

## Build and Deployment

### Optimize Bundle Size
- Use Hermes to reduce bundle size.
- Remove unused dependencies.
- Split code into multiple bundles for larger apps.

### Version Management
- Use semantic versioning for your app.
- Keep track of changes in a CHANGELOG.
- Set up automated version bumping in CI/CD.

### Configure CI/CD
- Set up continuous integration for automated testing.
- Implement continuous delivery for automated builds.
- Use fastlane or similar tools to automate deployment.

### App Store Optimization
- Create compelling screenshots and descriptions.
- Optimize keywords for app store search.
- Respond to user reviews promptly.

### Monitoring and Analytics
- Implement analytics to track user behavior.
- Monitor app performance in production.
- Track key metrics for business and technical KPIs.

## Final Considerations

### Keep Dependencies Updated
- Regularly update React Native and dependencies.
- Follow the React Native upgrade helper for major version updates.

### Follow Community Standards
- Adhere to the Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide or similar standard.
- Use ESLint and Prettier for code formatting and linting.

### Documentation
- Document complex components and business logic.
- Maintain a README with setup instructions and architecture overview.
- Include inline comments for complex logic.

By following these best practices, you'll build React Native applications that are secure, well-tested, and properly deployed with efficient maintenance processes.
